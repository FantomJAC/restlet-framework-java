Restlet/GAE is an edition that allows you to develop RESTful Web Applications that can
be deployed in <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/">Google App Engine</a>.
It is actually a port of the <a target="_top" href="/documentation/@version-minor@/api/">Restlet API for Java</a> 
to GAE 1.2 (Google App Engine) and above.<br/>
<br/>
The Restlet Framework is led by <a target="_top" href="http://www.restlet.com">Restlet S.A.S.</a>
with the help of the Restlet community.
